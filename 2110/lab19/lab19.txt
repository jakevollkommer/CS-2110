Objective: Use DMA to perform memset/memcpy in GBA games
 
This is a lab where you will use DMA in two different ways to copy data on the
GBA.

Note: You may not use the provided .s files for your homework.



Assignment
----------
In both of the provided C files, edit them appropriately to replace the given
for loops with DMA. main is designed to halt your code after some amount of
time if the drawing code is too slow, so even though the for loop
implementations are correct, they will not be able to draw the full screen.
However, DMA is much faster and will be capable of drawing it before time runs
out!

    clearscreen:

        An image will be drawn to the screen. Your job is to use DMA to clear
        the screen after it has been drawn. A correct solution won't use any
        iteration at all and will result in a completely black screen.

    copydata:

        A fullscreen image and a row number will be passed into the function,
        which should draw only the specified row to the videoBuffer. A correct
        solution won't use any iteration at all. When this is completed our code will iterate over all the rows and use your code to draw each row one at a time resulting in THE ENTIRE IMAGE being drawn to the screen.
