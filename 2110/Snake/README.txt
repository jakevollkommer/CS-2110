Snake!

My game uses the same logic as any classic game of snake. Your snake grows
every time you eat a cookie, and you remain alive as long as you dont hit into
yourself or a wall.

Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. You cannot reverse
your direction after eating your first cookie (This would cause you to die).
